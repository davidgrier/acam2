Acoustic Camera
===
The acam2 project consists of Arduino sketches and python code 
to control a single-frequency acoustic camera.  The camera's
hardware consists of a polargraph that scans a microphone across
a two dimensional field.  The microphone's output is measured 
by a two-phase lockin amplifier to obtain the amplitude and phase 
of the pressure field at each location.

The polargraph is driven by two stepper motors that are controlled
by an Arduino outfitted with a stepper motor controller.  The present
version includes Arduino sketches for version 1 and version 2 of 
the Adafruit Motor Shield.
